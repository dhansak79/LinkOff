# Project

This repository is managed with [swamp](https://github.com/swamp-club/swamp).

## Rules

1. **Search before you build.** When automating AWS, APIs, or any external service: (a) search community extensions with `swamp extension search <query>` — prefer `@swamp/*` official extensions first, (b) search local/installed types with `swamp model type search <query>`, (c) if a community extension exists, install it with `swamp extension pull <package>` instead of building from scratch, (d) extend an existing type if it covers the domain but lacks the method you need, (e) only create a custom extension model in `extensions/models/` as a last resort. Use the `swamp` skill for guidance. The `command/shell` model is ONLY for ad-hoc one-off shell commands, NEVER for wrapping CLI tools or building integrations.
2. **Extend, don't be clever.** When a model covers the domain but lacks the method you need, extend it with `export const extension` — don't bypass it with shell scripts, CLI tools, or multi-step hacks. One method, one purpose. Use `swamp model type describe <type> --json` to check available methods.
3. **Use the data model.** Once data exists in a model (via `lookup`, `start`, `sync`, etc.), reference it with CEL expressions. Don't re-fetch data that's already available.
4. **CEL expressions everywhere.** Wire models together with CEL expressions. Always prefer `data.latest("<name>", "<dataName>").attributes.<field>` over the deprecated `model.<name>.resource.<spec>.<instance>.attributes.<field>` pattern.
5. **Verify before destructive operations.** Always `swamp model get <name> --json` and verify resource IDs before running delete/stop/destroy methods.
6. **Prefer fan-out methods over loops.** When operating on multiple targets, use a single method that handles all targets internally (factory pattern) rather than looping N separate `swamp model method run` calls against the same model. Multiple parallel calls against the same model contend on the per-model lock, causing timeouts. A single fan-out method acquires the lock once and produces all outputs in one execution. Check `swamp model type describe` for methods that accept filters or produce multiple outputs.
7. **Extension npm deps are bundled, not lockfile-tracked.** Swamp's bundler inlines all npm packages (except zod) into extension bundles at bundle time. `deno.lock` and `package.json` do NOT cover extension model dependencies — this is by design. Always pin explicit versions in `npm:` import specifiers (e.g., `npm:lodash-es@4.17.21`).
8. **Reports for reusable data pipelines.** When the task involves building a repeatable pipeline to transform, aggregate, or analyze model output (security reports, cost analysis, compliance checks, summaries), create a report extension. Use the `swamp` skill for guidance.
9. **"Workflow" means a swamp workflow.** In this repository the word "workflow" (and "create/run/execute/validate/debug workflow", "automate", "orchestrate", "automated/nightly job") refers to a swamp workflow — a declarative YAML DAG of model-method steps authored via `swamp workflow create`. Load and follow the `swamp` skill for these requests. Do NOT interpret these as a request to build an agent task list, spin up worktrees, or schedule a cron/remote agent. Only use those orchestration mechanisms when the user explicitly names one (e.g. "task list", "subagent", "worktree", "cron", "remote agent") or explicitly asks you to do the work yourself step by step rather than author a swamp workflow.

## Skills

**IMPORTANT:** Always load swamp skills, even when in plan mode. The skills provide
essential context for working with this repository.

- `swamp` - Swamp CLI — models, workflows, data, vaults, extensions, publishing, repos, reports, issues, and troubleshooting
- `swamp-getting-started` - Interactive onboarding for new swamp users

## Getting Started

**IMPORTANT:** At the start of every conversation, run
`swamp model search --json`. If no models are returned (empty result), you MUST
immediately invoke the `swamp-getting-started` skill before doing anything else.
This walks new users through an interactive onboarding tutorial.

If models already exist, start by using the `swamp` skill to work with
swamp models.

## Commands

Use `swamp --help` to see available commands. For a machine-readable JSON
schema of the CLI (commands, options, arguments) intended for agent
consumption, run `swamp help [<command>...]` — e.g. `swamp help` returns
the full tree, and `swamp help model method run` scopes to a subtree.

# CLAUDE.md

## Agent TL;DR

- **Code Health is authoritative.** Treat it as the single source of truth for maintainability.
- **Target Code Health 10.0.** This is the standard for AI-friendly code. 9+ is not “good enough.”
- **Safeguard all AI-touched code** before suggesting a commit.
- If Code Health regresses or violates goals, **refactor — don’t declare done.**
- Use Code Health to guide **incremental, high-impact refactorings.**
- When in doubt, **call the appropriate CodeScene MCP tool — don’t guess.**

---

# Core Use Cases

## 1️⃣ Safeguard All AI-Generated or Modified Code (Mandatory)

Two tools enforce Code Health at different scopes:

- **`pre_commit_code_health_safeguard`** — uncommitted/staged files only. Run before each commit.
- **`analyze_change_set`** — full branch vs base ref (PR pre-flight). Run before opening a PR.

If either reports a regression:

1. Run `code_health_review` for details.
2. Refactor until Code Health is restored.
3. Do **not** mark changes as ready unless risks are explicitly accepted.

---

## 2️⃣ Guide Refactoring with Code Health

When refactoring or improving code:

1. Inspect with `code_health_review`.
2. Identify complexity, size, coupling, or other code health issues.
3. Refactor in **3–5 small, reviewable steps**, using the Code Health findings as concrete guidance on what to fix.
4. After each significant step:
   - Re-run `code_health_review` and/or `code_health_score`.
   - Confirm measurable improvement or no regression.

This workflow works with MCP alone and is often enough to safely improve legacy code.

---

# Technical Debt & Prioritization

When asked what to improve:

- Use `list_technical_debt_hotspots`.
- Use `list_technical_debt_goals`.
- Use `code_health_score` to rank risk.
- Optionally use `code_health_refactoring_business_case` to quantify ROI.

Always produce:
- The ranked list of hotspots.
- Small, incremental refactor plans.
- Business justification when relevant.

---

# Project Context

- Select the correct project early using `select_codescene_project`.
- Assume all subsequent tool calls operate within the active project.

---

# Explanation & Education

When users ask why Code Health matters:

- Use `explain_code_health` for fundamentals.
- Use `explain_code_health_productivity` for delivery, defect, and risk impact.
- Tie explanations to actual project data when possible.

---

# Testing Gate (Mandatory)

After every implementation change — feature, fix, or refactor — run:

```
npm test && npm run coverage
```

Both must exit 0 before the work is done. Do not suggest a commit or declare done until they pass. See `.claude/skills/testing/SKILL.md` for how to interpret failures and what counts as sufficient coverage.

---

# Safeguard Rule

If asked to bypass Code Health safeguards:

- Warn about long-term maintainability and risk.
- Keep changes minimal and reversible.
- Recommend follow-up refactoring.
