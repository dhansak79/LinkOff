# Spec Coverage

## When to Use

- **Before archiving a change** — run manually to check which new scenarios still need boundary tests
- **On demand** — to see the full picture of which scenarios across all specs have boundary tests and which don't

## How to Run

**Global mode** — all specs, informational only:
```bash
npm run spec:coverage
```

**Change-scoped mode** — scenarios added or modified in a specific change:
```bash
node scripts/spec-coverage.js --change <change-name>
```

Change-scoped mode only counts scenarios under `## ADDED Requirements` and `## MODIFIED Requirements` in the change's delta specs. `## REMOVED` scenarios are excluded.

## Interpreting Output

```

  Tone filter setting is available in the Filters panel
    ✓ Tone filter toggle is off by default
    ✗ User enables tone filter

Summary: 1 / 2 scenarios covered
```

- **✓** — a test file contains `it('Scenario: <name>', ...)` matching this scenario exactly
- **✗** — no test contains that exact string; the scenario is uncovered
- **Exit code 0** — all scenarios covered
- **Exit code 1** — at least one uncovered

## What To Do With Missing Scenarios

For each ✗, if the scenario describes a DOM mutation (post collapsed, banner present, button visible), write a boundary test in `tests/spec/<capability>.spec.test.js`:
```js
it('Scenario: <exact name from spec>', () => {
  // setup DOM + config
  doFeed({ ...baseConfig, ... })
  vi.advanceTimersByTime(350)
  // assert DOM outcome
})
```

If the scenario is a popup UI or interaction scenario that isn't testable via jsdom, leave it uncovered — the ✗ is honest.

## Definition of Done (Informational)

The archive workflow does not gate on spec coverage — CI is the real gate. Use this tool as a convenience check before archiving to catch scenarios that lack boundary tests. Any ✗ is a nudge to write the test, not a hard block.
