# FocusIn - LinkedIn Attention Filter

LinkedIn is doing real damage. Millions of people spend hours every day scrolling through AI-generated slop, engagement bait, and corporate noise dressed up as insight. Attention is finite. We are here to protect it.

FocusIn gives you back control of your LinkedIn feed — filtering out the garbage so the things that actually matter can get through.

> Forked from [njelich/LinkOff](https://github.com/njelich/LinkOff)

## Features

- Option to hide the whole feed, or sort it by recent instead of LinkedIn's algorithm
- Filter by custom keywords (politics, coronavirus, vaccination, whatever)
- Semantic topic filter — hide posts about a topic by meaning, not just keyword match (e.g. "hustle culture", "personal branding"), with your own custom topics too
- Hide posts shown due to interactions (comments, reactions, followed by connections)
- Hide irrelevant old posts (older than an hour, day, week, month)
- Filter job postings by keyword, and hide promoted jobs
- Select messages for mass deletion (clean your inbox)
- Unfollow all collections
- Block ads on LinkedIn (banners and sidebar)
- Hide notification counts, LinkedIn News, follow recommendations, and premium upsell prompts
- A "Today" dashboard in the popup showing how many AI posts and other posts have been filtered
- Fully configurable to suit your need!
- Completely FREE and with NO ADS

### AI Slop Detection

Collapse or completely hide posts that read like AI-generated content — buzzword phrases, filler hooks, emoji overload, raw markdown, contrasting clause structures, and wall-to-wall single-sentence line stacking. Posts that trip enough signals are either collapsed (with a reveal button) or hidden entirely, depending on your settings.

### AI Post Classification

Optionally label each post with its type (e.g. job update, article share, poll) using a small ML model that runs locally in the browser — nothing is sent to a server.

### Semantic Topic Filter

Beyond plain keyword matching, FocusIn can hide posts that are *about* a topic even if they don't use the exact words, using a local sentence-embedding model (runs entirely in-browser, no data leaves your machine). Pick from built-in topics or add your own.

FocusIn will be available in every browser on every device.

### Testing

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm test` | Run unit tests (fast, no coverage) |
| `npm run coverage` | Run unit tests with coverage report |
| `npm run mutate` | Run mutation tests |

CI enforces two quality gates on every PR:

- **Unit test coverage ≥ 90%** across lines, functions, branches, and statements (via [test.yml](https://github.com/dhansak79/FocusIn/actions/workflows/test.yml))
- **Mutation score ≥ 75%** (via [mutation.yml](https://github.com/dhansak79/FocusIn/actions/workflows/mutation.yml))

The latest [mutation report](https://dhansak79.github.io/FocusIn/) is published to GitHub Pages on each merge to `main`.
