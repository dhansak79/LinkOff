# FocusIn — LinkedIn Attention Filter

In early 2026 a barrier was crossed: the majority of LinkedIn posts were AI-generated. 53.7% to be specific.

AI content has a peculiar flavour. The em dashes, the hook–contrast–punchline structures, the emoji bullets, the wall-to-wall single-sentence lines. Each one is a small signal. Stacked together, they reliably mark a post that was effortless to produce — and, as a result, carries less value to read.

FocusIn detects those signals and gets them out of your way, so the posts written by actual humans with actual things to say have a chance of being seen.

## What it does

**AI slop detection** — scans every post for the tell-tale patterns of LLM-generated writing. When enough signals stack up, the post collapses to a one-line summary with a "Show anyway" button. You stay in control; nothing is permanently hidden.

**Semantic topic filter** — hides posts about a topic by *meaning*, not just keyword match. Uses a local sentence-embedding model that runs entirely in your browser — no data leaves your machine. Pick from built-in topics (hustle culture, personal branding, motivational quotes…) or add your own.

**Keyword filter** — straightforward exact-match filtering on any word or phrase you choose.

## How AI slop detection works

Posts are scored against a set of signals. Cross the threshold, and the post collapses:

| Signal | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Buzzword phrases** | "game-changer", "let that sink in", "thought leadership", "delve", "leverage" — two or more is a flag |
| **Contrast structures** | "It's not X. It's Y." hook–punchline pairs |
| **Listicle titles** | "7 habits that…", numbered thread formats |
| **Arrow bullet lists** | → used as bullets |
| **Em dash** | Rarely typed by hand; extremely common in AI writing |
| **Emoji overload** | More than 4 emoji in a post |
| **Emoji bullets** | Two or more lines each opening with an emoji |
| **Raw markdown** | `**bold**`, `# headers`, `* bullets` pasted straight from a chatbot |
| **Line stacking** | Short single-sentence lines throughout — the signature AI staccato rhythm |

Collapsed posts show a brief extractive summary so you can decide whether to expand without reading the full thing.

**Model-based detection** adds a second pass using a local classifier that scores posts against structural archetypes of AI writing, catching posts that pass the pattern checks but still read like a machine wrote them.

## FAQ

### Why was my post collapsed?

FocusIn looks for specific patterns that reliably appear in AI-generated posts. A single signal isn't enough — posts are only collapsed when several stack up together. The summary shown on a collapsed post lists which signals matched, so it's never a black box.

### Does any of this send my data anywhere?

No. The slop detector, semantic filter, and model-based classifier all run entirely inside your browser.

### What's the difference between keyword filtering and the semantic topic filter?

Keyword filtering hides a post only if it contains the exact word or phrase you typed. The semantic filter understands *meaning* — it can hide a post about "hustle culture" even if that phrase never appears, by comparing the post's content to your chosen topics using a local embedding model. It's slower than keyword matching; use it for themes that are hard to capture with a fixed list of words.

## Development

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm test` | Unit tests |
| `npm run coverage` | Unit tests with coverage report |
| `npm run knip` | Dead code check |
| `npm run mutate` | Mutation tests |

The pre-commit hook runs lint → dead code → coverage → patch coverage → CodeScene health on every commit.

CI enforces two quality gates on every PR:

- **Unit test coverage ≥ 90%** across lines, functions, branches, and statements
- **Mutation score ≥ 75%**

The latest [mutation report](https://dhansak79.github.io/FocusIn/) is published to GitHub Pages on each merge to `main`.
